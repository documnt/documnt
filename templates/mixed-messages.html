		<h1>Kurt Eidsvig<br>Mixed Messages</h1><br>
		<!-- <p style="width:452px;">“The question of the intersection of visual art and texts is at the heart of the poem and the project.” Mixed Messages was originally part of x/o — “a visual, sound and spoken-word installation” by Eidsvig, Martin Cockroft, and Brendan Murray, produced by the Fort Point Theatre Channel in Boston. “Martin Cockroft and I wrote the poetry which was read/performed by members of the Fort Point Theatre Channel. Also, I created a video and digital imagery projection work which was shown while Brendan Murray performed ambient music.” Eidsvig sees the X and the O as the building blocks of all letters: “the lines of the Xs and curves of the Os.” His approach in Mixed Messages was intuitive more than systematic: “I saw it as almost ‘action painting’ the texts.” In terms of the text selection, “the basis was trying to sample from different ‘genres’ of texts.” From the Bible’s “In the beginning was the word” passage to Frank O’Hara’s “Why I Am Not a Painter,” the idea behind Mixed Messages is “how we see things, what we see, perspective.”</p> -->
