		<p>Bisera Krckovska (Monochrome Modern)<br>On Transmission 01 & 02</p>
		<br>
		<!-- <p style="width: 580px;"> --><!-- Monochrome Modern’s overall artistic practice centers around repetitiveness and multiple interpretation of a particular idea. The repetition can be thought of as consistency; it is a conscious effort to clarify and emphasise one’s thought. By creating polyptychs and working in series, the concept I have and the technique I use are developed and extended as far as possible. The separate drawings of the polyptych create mood and set a broader atmosphere when simultaneously perceived.	<br>	 --><!-- The diptych “On transmission” is one of the works made on old library catalogue cards from the Hydrometeorological Service’s library in Skopje, Macedonia. Since the library has been using an online catalogue, the old typewritten catalogue cards are outdated and left as waste paper. After I came upon a few piles of these cards with the standard dimension of 120 x 75mm, I decided to use them in my work. In correspondence with my general attitude against the unnecessary and excessive usage of any kind of resources nowadays, I believe that the creative process of recycling can renew the qualities of the waste products.	<br> Matching this creative recycling process, the library cards’ content is recycled too. Heavily influenced by the popular “found poetry” created by words and phrases from other sources which are reframed as poetry by reordering, adding or deleting text, thus giving a new meaning, the short poems “On transmission” emerged. They are collages of the books’ titles and appear as simple readymades. By using this unpretentious method of turning a text into a poem, the old waste cards’s life and purpose is restored and their quality doubled.</p> -->
