			"Everyone reads life and the world like a book. Even the so-called ‘illiterate.’ But especially the ‘leaders’ of our society, the most ‘responsible’ nondreamers: the politicians, the businessmen, the ones who make plans. Without the reading of the world as a book, there is no prediction, no planning, no taxes, no laws, no welfare, no war. Yet these leaders read the world in terms of rationality and averages, as if it were a text-book. The world actually writes itself with the many-leveled, unfixable intricacy and openness of a work of literature..."

		<p class="essay-quote">If fossilized nonhuman lives appear as stone, Foucault’s infamous human lives appear as ashes or dried plants and flowers organized in an herbarium as an “anthology of existences.” And just as fossils appear as pictorial poems in the sedimented archive of nature, so too archival “poem-lives” appear in asylum registers and police reports to mark the passage of beings: sodomite monks and feeble-minded usurers. Further, Foucault tells us, their matter matters: unlike literary characters, he says, these beings “lived and died,” appearing to him only in their death, as a fossil would, in the form of petrified insect, fish, or worm. To be sure, unlike the fossil, the poem-life appears to us because of an encounter with power which, in striking down a life and turning it to ashes, makes it emerge, like a flash, out of the anonymous murmur of beings who pass without a trace.<br> <br>

		<p class="essay-quote">Between the language (langue) that defines the system of constructing possible sentences, and the corpus that passively collects the words that are spoken, the archive defines a particular level: that of a practice that causes a multiplicity of statements to emerge as so many regular events, as so many things to be dealt with and manipulated. It does not have the weight of tradition; and it does not constitute the library of all libraries, outside time and place; nor is it the welcoming oblivion that opens up to all new speech the operational field of its freedom; between tradition and oblivion, it reveals the rules of a practice that enables statements both to survive and to undergo regular modification.

PINDRONE addresses the issue of constitution and representation of reality through sounds and data. A microphone captures the constantly changing sound of an enviroment which is being transformed live into a drawing, printed by a dot matrix printer.
Firstly, a rather rudimentary set of questions was asked: When and how data are transformed into information. How significant are structuring and documentation of this data for the purpose of representation. In this context data and meta-data are negotiated as the smallest possible units of information which (supposedly) underlie the principle of forming knowledge within our society. The installation illustrates that every individual at any time produces data which could be meta-data of a superordinate system (whose objective is unknown to the individual) at its moment of generation. To reconstruct this data – then transform it into information and thus derive action - oriented intentions from it that have an impact on our everyday life – is an idea that is just as abstract as the idea that ordinary behavior and the pattern of actions of an individual holistically affect a social system. PINDRONE thematizes the seemingly depersonalized abstractness of the individual within the process of producing sets of data and meta- data and its consequential involvement in designing a holistic social system in which the individual is seen as a microscopical part . As early as the year 1927 sociologist , journalist and cultural critic Siegfried Kracauer formulated: »Al though the masses give rise to the ornament, they are not involved in thinking it through. As linear as it may be, there is no line that extends from the small sections of the mass to the entire figure. The ornament resembles aerial photographs of landscapes and cities in that it does not emerge out of the interior of the given conditions , but rather appears above them.«

PINDRONE formulates gaps and voids as the growing unknowing in the spaces inbetween of an document of time, of action and its meaning over time.
The representation of space through its sounds in lines of data in time is a certain refusal of meaning. Actions are hidden - unknown - they are already coded - interpreted - in realtime. a third party.</p> -->

		<p class="essay-quote">Nearly all the seeds that we sell are for annual plants, and were created by plants that have died.  The seeds we are selling now might get planted and grow next year, or the following year, or, if they are stored well, even ten years from now.  Most will live for a period of months -- unless they are thinned out much earlier.  In a cool, dark, dry place, the seed is ready to lie dormant for much longer than the time between its germination and its death.  In an exceedingly cold, dry, dark place, such as the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, seeds may lie dormant for longer than our own human lifespans. Many seeds from around the world have been sent to the Svalbard vault, but a tiny proportion of those have been taken back out, after wars or floods in the places where the primary (local or national) collections of those seeds were stored.<br>

Each type of flower is a work of art created and polished by generations of plants to be irresistible to certain pollinators.  As we continue, over the decades, to lose cultivated varieties, we lose flavors, crop genetic diversity, a certain sense of history, and crops' resilience to various disease and climactic pressures. Few of the varieties that our ancestors cultivated and saved seed from 100 years ago, are available today.</p> <br>

		<p><b>Daniel Temkin<br>Folders, 2015</b></p>
		
		<p>Folders are ghostly things. You can make 350,000 of them and they take up no space on disk:<br>
			<br>[img]<br>
			<br>
			This is because Windows considers directories structure rather than content. <br>
			<br>
			Both directories and files have entries in the Master File Table, a hidden catalog of the contents of a disk. The MFT can claim as much as the first 12% of disk space, a sort-of shadow section of the main partition called the MFT zone. Interacting with this table can only be accomplished through code and even then is discouraged, with poor documentation and changes resulting in a “festival of obscurity.” The MFT lists every file and where they sit on disk, but for folders, their entry in the MFT is their entire existence; they have no presence in usable disk space at all; hence taking up 0 bytes on disk.<br>
			<br>
			An empty folder is seemingly without purpose, its usefulness entirely in its potential to organize files. We can see this by the folder icons themselves. Each icon is based not on qualities of the folder itself (it has no essential qualities) but what content the folders are designated to hold:<br>
			<br>[img]<br>
			<br>
			When one comes across an empty folder, it is often deleted in annoyance; perhaps its creator got distracted and never finished whatever the folder was created to do, or it is a remnant of some abandoned project, left behind when the rest was deleted. A chain of empty folders is worse -- the sign of corrupted data from a bad disk sector or an application that didn’t completely uninstall. The labyrinth of empty folders is associated with hidden porn for a reason: porn is something we may not want found, but is only worth the effort of burying, not actually encrypting as we would a password or credit card number. <br>
			<br>[img]<br>
			<br>
			<em>A glance at the enigmatic MFT, which there is no easy way to access</em><br>
			<br>[img]<br>
			<br>
			<em>Make too many subdirectories and Windows complains that the path is too long and can't be edited or copied.</em><br>
			<br>
			But data has no inherent meaning, and even folders can be reinvented for new uses, to convey other meaning. Glitch art has shown us that treating data the “wrong” way can give us interesting if unexpected results. Applying sound effects to images can give us interesting visual effects that reveal the digital platform, undoing its simulation of the analog flow of an image. However, this is only possible because we can read the same data both as image and sound. To the machine, there is no distinction between image or sound: raw data is a string of numbers awaiting a system of reference, like letters in an unknown language; that system might be a file format, an encoding, or some other interpretive structure.<br>
			<br>
			Programming languages are exactly that: a syntactic system that treats strings of data as signifiers, and a set of rules about how those signifiers can be combined to produce various logical operations. The “esoteric” class of languages (esolangs) sit at the margins of programming languages, applying peculiar logic or interpretations of data. The most well-known of these languages, brainfuck, showed that eight punctuation signs, when read the right way, can enact algorithms as complex and powerful as C++. <br>
			<br>
			<b>The Folders programming language</b><br>
			<br>
			The Folders programming language is written entirely in the combinations of folders within folders. They create a pattern which is decoded into a series of commands, based entirely on how many folders are in each folder’s sub-folders, read alphabetically down the chain.<br>
			<br>
			This is the Hello, World program:<br>
			<br>[img]<br>
			<br>
			A Folders command is a folder with at least one sub-folder. The first of folders within this first sub-folder determines which command it is:<br>
			<br>[img]<br>
			<br>
			So, a folder with three folders in it, the first of which has zero sub-folders, is an “if” statement. The command’s second sub-folder (read alphabetically) will have an expression to evaluate the conditional of the if statement (the expression which resolves to true or false, what is between the parentheses of a C-style if statement). The third will have another command or set of commands to be run if the statement is true. It can contain any series of other commands, perhaps even another “if” statement.<br>
			<br>[img]<br>
			<br>
			Just as code has a structure of containment -- blocks of code holding other blocks -- folders contain other folders. Like natural language, code is recursive: commands can contain other commands, just as sentences can be built from phrases that hold other phrases, indefinitely deep.<br>
			<br>
			We see this visually in code that is tabbed in within blocks. The curly brackets indicating containment on the left corresponds to the literal containment of commands in the Folders syntax, on the right:<br>
			<br>[img]<br>
			<br>
			<em>You could re-organize your C: drive into a Folders program.</em><br>
			<br>
			<b>Concise Folders</b><br>
			<br>
			If you’re the kind of programmer who finds creating 101 folders too much for a Hello, World program, there is a more concise variation of Folders, for the programmer who doesn’t feel gross using actual text in a program. In this variation, the text of the folder name indicates the command or other keyword. However, in the spirit of opacity, these command names (if, while, etc) are replaced with the most common folder names in Windows (New Folder, Temp, etc) -- the most common command name to the most common folder name in use:<br>
			<br>
			Commands<br>
			<br>[img]<br>
			<br>
			Types<br>
			<br>[img]<br>
			<br>
			<b>FoldersFS</b><br>
			<br>
			Folders was inspired in part by Whitespace, perhaps the first language to treat what is traditionally non-content as content. Created in 2003 by Edwin Brady and Chris Morris, the language uses only space, tab, and return to write code, characters ordinarily used interchangeably, and only to separate words. Folders extends this sense of the immaterial by eliminating files entirely. While a Whitespace file may look blank, it still holds many lines of spaces and tabs; a Folders program is indistinguishable from a chance configuration of directories.<br>
			<br>
			As we have seen, a side-effect of this is that the code takes up no space on disk; as a structural feature of the file system, folders technically take up no space on disk. This seems like a rather attractive feature, so it’s been extended through FoldersFS, a parallel file system for Windows that allows for infinite disk space (just don’t look too closely as the disk space shrinks / MFT expands). The way it does this is very simple.<br>
			<br>
			The Folders programming language already avoids interaction with files. It minimizes its reliance on memory by storing all temp data in another set of folders, held in the user’s %appdata% directory. Likewise, the preferred method of I/O with a Folders program is another set of folders. Instead of writing text to the screen, it can be redirected to write to a folder name, with the user responding by changing the name of another folder. This means that all interaction can be through folders, in addition to having program state maintained as folders.<br>
			<br>
			Since data can be stored as long file paths, there’s now no reason to keep any data in folders. Using the folders language to read and write data, files can be bypassed completely. A file can be broken apart, with each piece of binary data properly escaped and encoding in hex, and then stored either in the Folders numeric format (each hex digit a folder with a set of sub-folders of its binary representation), or even path-encoded into the name of a folder, for those who want something more human-readable.<br>
			<br>
			Either way, Folders becomes a parallel file system, bypassing files completely. Its pineal gland is the executable itself, the one file necessary to activate a purely folders-based interaction. <br>
			<br>[img]<br>
			<br>
			This means you can store all of your data in the MFT “free” zone, where all data is 0 bytes. Just don’t look too closely at how large Windows thinks your disk is!

		<p class="essay-quote"><!-- 1. EXCESS<br>
			Works that are ‘too big’ or represent a sort of ‘information overload’ invite new ways of reading -- that is, a reading as a process of collection, a process of selection. This allows for a proliferation of meanings and readings to develop and explode the possibilities found within the text. Both in individual objects/files and an archive of excess, new intersections and juxtapositions create a space of potential. In Poetics of Information Overload, Paul Stephens writes about this type of excess:<br>
			<br>
			“This excess information takes on the form of a catalog, which, like an index, is radically selective, but also potentially radically generative of associations” (166)<br>
			<br>
			The archive is not the final resting place of texts, but becomes the space in which texts are shifted through and revitalized. Through the messiness of this space, readers have to take on the role of curation.<br>

		<h1><b>Ella Coon<br> 
		Digitized Archives, Digital Archives: New Genres and the Gallery of the Scanner, 2017<br>Essay</b></h1><br>
		<p style="text-align:right">
			<em>The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries.</em> <br>
			<br>
			— Jorge Luis Borges, “The Library of Babel”
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Since the ubiquity of the internet and the advent of (relatively) affordable scanners, there has been push to digitize archives—translating physical documents into easily stored, easily mined, often cloud-based, sharable files. Concurrently, with the upswing in online interactions, via web-based journalism platforms and social media, an impulse to create archives of these digital “paper-trails”, (take sites like archiveit.org or the recent debate over whether or not President Donald Trump’s Twitter feeds, @POTUS and @realDonaldTrump, constitute part of the official presidential archive) has also arisen. <br>
			<br>
			Scanners—instead of creating some sort of digital safety net for documents via digital replicas—open up physical documents, physical archives, to technological advantages far outweighing those of other modes of reproduction, i.e. photocopies. Scans allow for perfect duplicability, shareability (complemented by things like email), flexibility in sizing and format (extending use value), more efficient forms of organization (through file-naming), better “searchability” (via encoding), as well as a more easeful establishment of archival “relation”. These last three features, provided by metadata, are something the analogue world does not afford. <br>
			<br>
			The archive, then, literally takes on a fourth dimension—via its capacities for translation, potential duplication, alteration, and encoding—navigable through overlapping indexes and a search bar.<br>
			<br>
			However this interpretation of digital translation, of “the scanner”, is not applicable to all archives, even digital ones (e.g. @realDonaldTrump).<br>
			<br>
			But, why?<br>
			<br>
			Not all digital archives rely on translation, specifically those made from digitally-born or web-based materials. In addition, some online archives are community oriented, requiring actual participation in their creation, such as aaaaarg.fail. A distinction between digitized archives and digital archives then exits. They are disparate forms with different aspirations—distinct thrust.</p><br>
			<p class="essay-quote">Digitized archives—an appendage of physical archives—envision the digital as a tool. As a result, they not only maintain their interest in bibliography and provenance, but also resist a transition to a more people-centric model, deferring instead to institution, to insular control, and to the mediation and placement of discrete (translations of) objects and histories via prescribed methodology. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				(Physical archives are sorted according to a nesting-egg structure of provenance—collection, series, files, and item—fleshing history through ripples of description and citation, closeted away for later inspection. Archival science is not a “science” concerned with arranging, finding, or really even sharing items, but a discipline active around discovering and implementing better ways to protect and preserve an object’s not only physical condition but also discrete identity, it’s history—through language and placement—for posterity. It relies on hierarchy, on methodology, language, and physical space to understand itself; knowledge arises from both a physical and conceptual proximity.)<br>
				<br>
			</p>
			<p class="essay-quote">
				Digital archives, on the other hand, aspire to a horizontality, to dispersal, to reach, expressed through public engagement, algorithms (which are inherently subjective), randomization, and search bars. Take archive.org and archiveit.org. The former is a largely unorganized amassment of historical media in digital reprint. The latter constitutes a public database, tracking what people/the media establishment have/has been doing and saying online through a loose interpretation of archival notions of “series” and “collection”. Both sites are of the community-oriented model. Both eschew orthodox notions of description, context, and relation. Both desire viewership. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The physical’s amassment is illegible, enfolding an insight greater than any contrived objectivity, a fragment nonetheless; an index buttressing against erasure. It is impassive, if not peeved, by a public presence. <br>
				<br>
				The digital eschews notions of time, of space. It is convenience-based, an ebbing and expanding networked sinew submissive to the fickle impulses of the virtual wanderer. <br>
				<br>
				The researcher is probably indifferent to these dispositions. She might even prefer digital, due to its ease and efficiency. <br>
				<br>
				Media theorist Wolfgang Ernst, in Digital Archives and Memory, writes, “As long as media are not mistaken for their mass-media content, they turn out to be nondiscursive entities, belonging to a different temporal regime that, to be analyzed, requires an alternative means of description.” With this statement, Ernst is not referring to an artificial divide between form (or, the digital apparatus, i.e. “nondiscursive entities”) and content (i.e. “mass-media content”) or between micro (media-based) and macro (historical) trends. Instead, he is pointing to the fact that these “nondiscursive entities” are themselves a type of content, a type of media (“not to be mistaken [for]… mass-media content”), both influencing as well as evolving from a collective engagement with the media itself. Distinct analytical frames between this evolving digital apparatus and “mass-media content” are then needed, so that the macro (historical) and micro (processional) developments that they originate from can be evaluated, separated, and interwoven. <br>
				<br>
				This is the job of the media archaeologist. I am not a media archaeologist.<br>
				<br>
				That said, isolating the scanner/scans positions it/them as a catalyst, not because it/they actually is/are a catalyst (a watershed innovation singly tipping the movement of archives from physical to digital) but as metonym for a larger system—the translation of materials from analogue to digital in the context of archives—asking why would you undergo this project of translation, if it wasn’t for the sake of posterity? And what does it mean for the Archive to prioritize public engagement over posterity itself, as web-based archives often do? <br>
				<br>
				The answer seemed to be heightened communication and research capacities. But the real point was to illustrate the fracturing of institution of Archive into genre itself: in no other historical time has an archivist privileged any other aspect of archival work (i.e. communication and public reach) over posterity and provenance. <br>
				<br>
				I don’t have the space, appropriate analytical frames, or foresight, to predict what this shift in archives (both in the structure of archives in an this new conception of Archive as a form of media, having distinct genres) will have on our individual and collective understandings of memory, research, and knowledge more generally. But it isn’t out of the question to assume that this conversion might fit into our “op-ed” concerns over the internet itself, specifically “googlization”.<br>
				<br>
				“Googlization” broadly takes two forms. The first plays into a narrative about the search bar massaging the impulsive, ends-seeking aspects of the human psyche, resulting in an inability to concentrate and imposing limitations on humans’ capabilities for abstract thought, stunting conceptual scope.  The second is about concentrations of power, and who owns what and who has access re: the digital. For example, Google possesses surfers’ browsing data via Chrome (selling this information to desirous retailers for targeted advertisement; we all know what this looks like) in addition to controlling what you see when you “search” through their search engine, as well as having their own technologies, such as “Google Drive” (one of the more advanced forms of cloud-storage), under lock and key. <br>
				<br>
				It is then our (or the media archaeologist’s) responsibility to assess these interlocking macro (historical, i.e. concentrations of capital, questions of transparency) and micro (processional, i.e. the scanner) trends re: the digital. Only then can a (more) full picture of Archive (as a digital media expressing genre) fit into questions of individual psychic structure, collective knowledge, access, and the potential monopolization of memory. <br>
				<br>
				Maybe, these archival adaptations will fulfill the digital’s prophecy of horizontality. Maybe, this will be a good thing. Or maybe (hopefully not), we’ll conform to Borges’ Book Man—who, while looking for the total book of knowledge, never manages to see the Library in its full dimension, nor finishes writing his own book. Only time, under the scrutiny of the media archeologist, will tell.
