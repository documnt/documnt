        <p>While it's practically normalized in the West today, what is known as the field of 'design' first emerged in the early 1920s from a fixation with form and visual economy. In its earliest days in Weimar, Germany, a collective of painters, architects, and industrial designers known as the Bauhaus sought a new mode of formal education that emphasized the "function of art" and "a new kind of artist" trained in meeting human needs that, based on form and human intuition, would extend out to serve the greater needs of the society and republic. In his prospectus, Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius called for "a creator capable of understanding every kind of need: not because he is a prodigy, but because he knows how to approach human needs according to precise method." Designers would be egalitarian aesthetes of the everyday—purveyors of clean lines and soothing shapes, formalized in modes of production set to make daily life seamless and straightforward without obstruction. Bauhaus built iconic structures like Marcel Breuer's Wasilly chair or William Wagenfeld's early "Bauhaus lamp," finally merging aesthetics with the functionality of the tactile object.</p>
        <p>Bringing this tradition into the late 1960s, Italian sculptor (and otherwise constructor of 'Useless Machines') Bruno Munari notoriously perpetuated the mythos of the designer-as-artist in the aptly-titled Design as Art:</p>

      <div class="block-quote">
        <p>The designer is therefore the artist of today, not because he is a genius but because he works in such a way as to reestablish contact between art and the public, because he has the humility and ability to respond to whatever demand is made of him by the society in which he lives, because he knows his job, and the ways and means of solving each problem of design. And finally because he responds to the human needs of his time, and helps people to solve certain problems without stylistic preconceptions or false notions of artistic dignity deprived from the schism of the arts.
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <p>Growing through time into a formal design establishment, the ethos of the early Bauhaus movement and its offshoots saw the designer as both 'artist' and 'service worker'—one to bridge the gap between the increasing precarity of avant-garde art and the practical necessity/utilitarianism of object-oriented construction. Design was a way to tame avant-garde aesthetics, to repurpose an ethos of 'progress' to suit formal, cultural needs.</p>

        <p>But like all artistic languages, design is inherently political. As Boris Groys notes in In the Flow, the uniforms of Nazi Germany famously leveraged design to "make the Nazi movement more attractive, more seductive," and while they are now at least partially remembered for their design flaws, the party was notorious for its extraordinary attention to the detail of design. As Steven Heller notes for Design Observer,</p>

      <div class="block-quote">
        <p>Hitler’s fervent desire to attain propaganda supremacy among nations was a direct result of the German defeat in World War I and his belief that superior allied propaganda trumped Kaiser Wilhelm II’s meager output. Through intensive barrages of posters and other visual media, Britain and America effectively defamed the 'Hun' in the eyes of the world, portraying the Kaiser’s military as callous blood-thirsty beasts. The German counterattack was tepid at best…So when the Nazis came to power, Hitler commissioned a book titled Das Politische Plakat: Eine Psychologische Betrachtung by Erwin Schockel, a psychological assessment of English, American, French, Russian and German political posters. It was a handbook for German propagandists and others.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <p>Propaganda on the German front formed around the political malleability of design, something that Sheldon Wolin has called "inverted totalitarianism." In Democracy Incorporated: Managed Democracy and the Specter of Inverted Totalitarianism, Wolin notes that design became a key tool of the Nazi and Fascist regimes to leverage public opinion; their campaigns became full-fledged attacks on American and British visual identity in heights unprecedented— flags and banners, songs and stadiums, work and play indefinitely. Similarly, Russian Productivists, in many ways tangential to the Constructivist movement of the 1920s and 30s, saw both design and avant-garde art as respective masteries of form, mechanically produced to fit practical forms in society. Productivists like Alexander Rodchenko and Aleksei Gan moved between art and design, corroding distinctions between advertising, propaganda, and an artistic tradition with a newfound utilitarian emphasis.</p>
        <p>And yet, design lives on, seamless in political and cultural life throughout the West. In "The Society of the Spectacle," Guy Debord defines the spectacle as fundamentally a "social relationship between people that is mediated by images;" by extension, I'd contest that design as a practice is the manipulation of that spectacle—the careful work of market research, color psychology, and an extended tradition of subliminal advertising in the West, reliant on modes of alienation and commodity fetishism to sell ideology back to the citizen under capitalism.  If, as Deleuze and Guattari famously theorize in Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, manipulation of the production process is the most fundamental exchange under capitalism, then design is the lubricant that eases this production together—leveraging aesthetics and visual identities to mobilize and maximize the efficiency of capitalist production.</p>
        <p>But like many relics of the twentieth century, this has seen thorough critique. From Adbusters and "culture jamming" to Henry Giroux's call for a critical pedagogy in youth media literacy, the critical world feels rife with critiques of the extenuating modes of production through which design operates. And yet, few seem to grasp at overarching modes of design in its totality, opting rather to critique its many, ever-shifting faces in popular forms rather their sources in schools of thought. Design as a mode of thought is vast and ever changing—constantly co-opting the evolving languages of public discourse and popular media, both to dramatize the designer's own utility and to reify hegemonic order—that such critiques become impossibly huge beyond the scope of this essay. But nonetheless, Western iterations currently revolve around one underlying unifier of cultural exchange: the streamlining of alienation under late capitalism.</p>

        <p>Which leads us to a lofty, unwavering question: could design as a practice exist outside capitalism? Can design exist beyond a Western world where the cultural order is forever reliant on aesthetics of some nature to reify power? Are designers just precarious actors in the expensive, theatric production of the dominant cultural order?</p>
        <p>In short, obviously yes—while designers under capitalism could be spun as glorified bureaucrats, as is the case for Erwin Montgomery, who in his piece "Design is a Bureaucrat," conflates the role of the designer with our "vast, decentered bureaucracy to administer a regime of inverted totalitarianism through the licensing, validation, evaluation, registration, and distribution of desire in acceptable expressions," there are certainly modes of design that exist outside of this space. Web designers, for example, have risen from a long tradition of joyous, playful experimentation born from the bottom-up tradition of the internet. In many ways, the web was a new design frontier, in years formally establishing its own inevitable landscape in UI and UX design—where splash pages became entry points, Java and jQuery gave it motion, and everything moved without authorship. Many design studios have become one-stop shops for everything from branding and visual design to apps, icons, and SEO optimization in a growing need for the visual authority of design online and soon, web design became yet another tentacle of the theatric production of capitalist media, a new spectacle for the alienation of a younger generation.</p>
        <p>Many designers, disillusioned with their complicity in the production of capitalist power, have come together in the last few years, working out ways to resist capitalism through the design practice to answer my above question. One firm in particular has put together an evolving manifesto for anticapital designers globally, a mode to resistance to the current cultural order beyond submission.</p>
        <p>From the beginnings of what became their first published ebook, Metahaven lays out a call to action for designers in our age of precariousness—of AIG bailouts and income inequality unprecedented, of gentrification and bourgeois stereotypes of a generation "proficien[t] at brewing lattes and baking cupcakes." In Can Jokes Bring Down Governments?: Memes, Design, and Politics, they write,</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-quote">
        <p>So, how might graphic designers contribute? The failure of corrupted political entities to properly represent anyone who mandated them to assume governing power is somewhat analogous to the crisis confronted by graphic designers in their eroding role as mediators and representatives of institutions…Design, gradually but certainly, has shifted from being a middleman in the social fabric between people and institutions, to functioning as a direct index of conditions of life and work in a given place. In other words, design is a direct agent of the socio-political realities lived by its makers…The designer once operated at the behest of an institution, be it the Postal Service, or a museum, or the subway, which maintained the infrastructure of social democracy. Now that this infrastructure has collapsed, designers are becoming increasingly unpaid, and are also 'released' from the frame that gave their activity meaning and purpose within the socio-democratic fabric. This relative loss makes designers both qualified, and ready to take the next step.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <p>At the turn of the decade, many disillusioned designers have hit the same wall, pushing forward with the proverbial “next step” into defining/refining modes of "critical" or "anticapital design" that lie outside modes of capitalist production. While definitions vary, Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, of Dunne & Raby fame, once formally defined this anticapital design as the "[use of] speculative design proposals to challenge narrow assumptions, preconceptions and givens about the role graphic communication plays in everyday life." As a term, it's been ridiculed by designers and critics alike, but many principles of the movement embody a sort of radical potential never before felt in the often bureaucratic service work of design.</p>

        <p>Metahaven, for one, have established a visual identity built on the playfulness of early web culture, embracing bright hues, garish drop shadows and skewed hierarchies that reject many of elements of established visual order. Pairing anticapital text with borrowed elements from Wikileaks icons and images of digital activists like Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, and Aaron Swartz, the firm have made heroes of the digital rogues of our times and established forms of anticapital design that makes the anticapital desirable, 'branding' the principals of anticapital discourse to 'market' their radical text. While they do use these aesthetics to market their own books, it seems their intentions are more set on transparency at large, mostly in the form of design education through political theory. Their latest text, Black Transparency: The Right to Know in the Age of Mass Surveillance is a hefty, theoretical work encompassing everything from critiques of media conglomerates and state-sponsored TV networks to income inequality and data privacy in a sea of sharp examples of what they call “Black Transparency,” or “a frontal attack on the autonomy of the executive branch.” The work draws on theorists and contemporary politics alike to bridge an information gap between institutional theory and the sorts of socialist grassroots organization that have found footing on the internet with groups like Anonymous and #BlackLivesMatter, both of whom the school draw on in the work. The work dramatizes the aesthetic production of internet activism itself, both 'marketing' radical ideology through aesthetics and filling in gaps with a narrative of their own design, a call to action in an age of precarity.</p>

        <p>In some sense, this use of aesthetics to 'market' their theory is no different than the aforementioned modes of design under capitalism, again returning to my original question. But I want to suggest another possible reading, one rooted in the Marxist critiques of J.K. Gibson-Graham. In The End of Capitalism (As We Knew It), Gibson-Graham seek to problematize notions of a single, monolithic 'capitalism' on which all critiques are built. The pair write,</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block-quote">
        <p>When we say that most economic discourse is 'capitalocentric,' we mean that other forms of economy (not to mention noneconomic aspects of social life) are often understood primarily with reference to capitalism: as being fundamentally the same as (or modeled upon) capitalism, or as being deficient or substandard imitations; as being opposite to capitalism; as being the complement of capitalism; as existing in capitalism's space or orbit. Thus noncapitalist practices like self-employment may be seen as taking place within capitalism, which is understood as an embracing structure or system. Or noncapitalist activity may be elided, as when 'commodification' is invoked as a metonym for capitalist expansion. Noncapitalist economic forms may be located in 'peripheral' countries that lack the fullness and completeness of capitalist "development." Noncapitalism is found in the household, the place of woman, related to capitalism through service and complementarity. Noncapitalism is the before or the after of capitalism: it appears as a precapitalist mode of production (identified by its fate of inevitable supersession); it appears as socialism, for which capitalism is both the negative and the positive precondition.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <p>In constructing a narrative of design around capitalism, I've fallen victim to Gibson-Graham's false distinction between 'capitalism' and 'noncapitalist' forms of possibility. Following their reading, 'commodification' of Metahaven's text maybe isn't necessarily capitalist; only when framed within a 'capitalocentric' context would such a practice necessarily be considered commodity production. While in its current form it is bought and sold as a market commodity, the text speaks towards a future of possibility beyond the liminal spectrum of contemporary global capitalism, offering a potential greater than a reductive distinction between capitalist and noncapitalist leaves room for.</p>
        <p>The path from capitalism to notions of non- or anti-capitalism is often both speculative and immaterial, especially in critical theory/arts critiques in pursuit of the eternally untapped possibility of utopian desire. While it's hard to gauge the staying power of modes of non- or anti-capital aesthetics, Metahaven presses out against the limits of design to critique structures of power, embrace modes of being in forms that grasp beyond capitalist exchange, and work to continue both activism and social research into uncharted terrain beyond the market. Where ‘design’ hits a wall at the limits of aesthetic manipulation, Metahaven pushes onward in the production of anti-capital text, with their own design principles and aesthetics as vehicles for larger critiques impossible with design alone. If, as Marshall McLulhan has seminally stated, the medium is the message, then Metahaven’s “message” transcends media in pursuit of a larger, multi-faceted critique. Only upon transcending its own media can design be more than aestheticized scaffolding. Metahaven’s approach bounds outward with a voice for change that transcends media firmly in pursuit of progressive reform.</p>
