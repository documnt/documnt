When we stand in front of it
The grid of knobs yell conformity
trapped inside white walls, no doors
When we touch it
Electrons scatter, bringing paranoia, tear the plaster
When we turn it on
Speakers growl
They donâ€™t understand

But when we grasp the faders, the knobs, the filters
Power vibrates to all through the room
