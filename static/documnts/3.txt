	I went to a Turkish cafe south of Kotti today on my way from 
	language class to the Turkish market. I stopped because I was
	hungry and wanted some caffeine too. 
										
	I ordered tea and a dish with eggs and lamb for 4,50â‚¬, and it 
	came with a large basket of soft and aromatic Turkish bread.

	Oh no, I thought, bread.

	I ate it. I tore off soft pieces of bread and slid them through
	the grease on my plate. I slid them against the greasey eggs 
	and peppers and made pockets in the bread and spooned scrambled
	eggs and lamb into the pockets and ate it. I ate almost all the 
	bread in the basket. 

	And then I sat back against the leather cushion in my corner and 
	looked at the warm Turkish decorations on the walls and the people
	eating and drinking tea inside and the smell of sesame seeds. I 
	ordered an espresso.


	The first sip of the espresso burned my tongue and was bitter.
	I waited and remembered how I used to drink espresso, sipped 
	hard at the edge of the cup so air came in with the coffee, and
	the pleasure from this was deep and robust like I remembered it 
	so I did it again and again until the cup was empty, and then I 
	left for the market.
